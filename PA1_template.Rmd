## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(xtable)
library(flextable)
library(tidyr)
activity = read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
activity_noNA = activity %>% 
  na.omit()
hist(activity_noNA$steps)
```

```{r}
mean(activity_noNA$steps)
median(activity_noNA$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
plot(activity$interval, activity$steps, type = "l")
```

```{r}
which.max(activity$steps)
```

## Imputing missing values

```{r}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

```{r}
activity_fill = activity %>%
  replace_na(list(steps = 0))
  
```

```{r}
hist(activity_fill$steps)
```

```{r}
activity_fill %>% 
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(mean(steps), median(steps))
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}

```
